2025 Update Log:
https://devforum.roblox.com/t/-/3446058

Getting Started:
    - We recommend storing HD Admin in 'ServerScriptService'
	- Receive automatic updates by going to Core -> PackageLink and enabling 'AutoUpdate'
	- The Core cannot be changed otherwise HD Admin will stop functioning
	- You can configure Ranks, Gamepasses, etc in the 'Settings' module
	- You can add your own commands under Config -> Commands
	- You can delete 'ThumbnailCamera' - this is used to give the model an image
	- You are automatically given the rank Owner
	- To sell gamepasses via HD Admin 'ThirdPartySales' must be enabled:
		- Go to Home (on the Studio topbar) -> Game Settings -> Security -> Tick 'Allow Third Party Sales' and Save
